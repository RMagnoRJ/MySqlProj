Justificativa de entrega de projeto:

First of all, I'd like very much to say that I am completely exhausted with the lack of care about Descomplica's students this trimester!

I watched several YouTube videos trying to understand how to connect Firebase with Ionic since the teacher didn't do part of it, leaving the students without the necessary knowledge.  In the end I just gave up! fortunately   today, out of the blue, I found an Indian dev who taught me how to do it. 
The guy was just A-MAZING!!! 

Here the YouTube link:

After several hours I could finally understand how to integrate Firebase Realtime Database with Ionic App through VS Code! So, since the 14 Practical Activity is about product and stock I developed a warehouse app!

MySql Warehouse App was conceived today! It was a ideia that came to me when I was coding the Indian classes. My app was created thinking about agility, mobility and precision.

It's about taking care of your business 24 hours a day from the palm of your hand to your pocket! Just be on top of your stock everytime without missing any log.

MySql Warehouse App is a simple solution designed by a small business man! It's not about big companies and very expensive businesses... It's the other way around! Simple, cheap, agile and modern!

It's just about one click! 
What are you waiting for!? 
Go for it!
Try MySql Warehouse App now and start the fun today!
Who said that work can not be fun!? =D

MySql Warehouse App is a fun solution for your day!
